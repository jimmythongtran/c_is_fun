This is where I am putting C projects I am working on for fun. Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/kinalee/having_fun_coding_in_c">kinalee</a>.
A lot of these projects are initially from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Absolute-Beginners-Guide-3rd/dp/0789751984">The Absolute Beginner's Guide to C Programming by Greg Perry and Dean Miller</a>.
